    <h1>Saving Goals</h1>
    <p>1. Set up three variables:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>startingBalance: Initialize this variable with your 
        initial savings balance. For example, you can set it 
        to 1000.</li>
      <li>monthlyContribution: Set this variable to the amount 
        you plan to save each month.</li>
      <li>months: Specify the number of months for which you want to track your 
        savings. For instance, you can set it to 12 for a year.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>2. Calculate the total savings after the specified 
      number of months by using the formula 
      startingBalance + (monthlyContribution * months) and 
      store the result in a variable called totalSavings.</p>

      <p>3. Print the result by using console.log to display 
        the total savings you'll have after the specified number
         of months. For example:

        After 12 months of saving, you will have $4000 in your 
        account.</p>
        <p>4. Run your JavaScript program to see how much
           money you'll have saved after the specified time period.</p>
